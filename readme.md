# About this repo

I am currently learning Rust so this is just my attempt for the 2024 Advent of Code in Rust. The solutions might not be optimal but they get the job done!

# For missing parts

- Part 1s of certain days have been overwritten so please check the [commit history](https://github.com/bhavishya-sahdev/aoc-24/commits/master/) for any missing part code you might be looking for.
